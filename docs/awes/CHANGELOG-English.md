# 24.2.6

⏰ 2025-10-25

## AWES
- 🛠️ `Shortcut Toolbar Manager`: The fields `Executable Path`, `Parameters`, and `Working Executable Path` have been fixed in the shortcut editing interface. You can now modify the contents of these fields. After making changes, click `Save` and then `Apply` to apply them immediately.

- ➕ `Shortcuts`: New shortcuts have been added.
Among the new shortcuts, the one for launching `chromium` stands out. If AWES is installed on a drive other than "C:\", you must edit the shortcut before using it and change the drive letter in the execution parameters to ensure the `default profile` is saved correctly and portably.
